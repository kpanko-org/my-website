Every January, I watch large organizations hit themselves in the face with the same rake.

Everyone knows the work is coming. The teams are staffed. The roadmaps exist. I’ve already sat in the meetings where people talk confidently about what we’ll build *this year*. And then January arrives—and suddenly, no one is allowed to work.

Contractors are benched. People are told to burn PTO. Middle managers start sending apologetic messages they shouldn’t have to write. Finance and procurement wait for paperwork to line up, as if this were a surprise.

I’ve lived through this cycle more than once. And what finally made it click for me wasn’t the frustration—it was realizing that this isn’t bad planning. It’s a system working exactly as designed.

## What It Looks Like on the Ground

From the contractor or vendor side, January looks like this:

- “We expect approvals any day now.”
- “Please take PTO until the contract is finalized.”
- “We can’t let you work until we have a PO.”

From the client side, it sounds like:

- “Finance hasn’t released the budget yet.”
- “Legal still needs to sign off.”
- “Procurement is processing the renewal.”

None of this is surprising. It happens every year. Often at the same companies. Often with the same partners.

And yet every year, it’s treated as if it were an unfortunate but unavoidable accident.

## The Incentives Explain Everything

Once you look at incentives, the behavior makes perfect sense.

### The Client Company

Finance and procurement are not rewarded for continuity. They are rewarded for:

- Preventing unauthorized spend
- Enforcing compliance
- Avoiding audit findings

Letting work begin before formal approval creates risk—career risk. A few weeks of disruption is cheaper than one compliance incident. So approvals move slowly, especially at the start of a fiscal year.

### The Vendor Company

The vendor has a different fear: unpaid labor.

Without an executed contract or purchase order, they cannot invoice. Letting employees work “on good faith” risks:

- Lost revenue
- Margin erosion
- Accounting and reporting problems

So the risk is pushed downward. Employees are benched. PTO is encouraged or required. Utilization metrics are protected.

From a balance sheet perspective, this is rational.

## Where the Pain Actually Lands

The people who feel this most are the ones with the least power to change it.

Middle managers know:

- The work is real
- The work is needed
- The delay is artificial

But they don’t control budgets, contracts, or procurement timelines. They’re measured on delivery and utilization, yet blocked by systems they can’t influence.

Contractors and vendor employees absorb the cost directly—in lost time, forced PTO, and uncertainty.

Senior leadership rarely experiences this pain firsthand, which makes it easy to categorize as “seasonal friction.”

## Why It Never Gets Fixed

This pattern persists because it is *stable*.

- The cost is externalized to people least able to object
- The disruption is short enough to be tolerated
- The risk avoidance benefits accrue upward

Fixing it would require someone with authority to accept a small amount of financial or legal risk in exchange for continuity. That trade-off rarely looks attractive inside large bureaucracies.

So instead, the organization pays the same hidden tax every year.

## The Quiet Lesson

The real lesson of the January contract freeze isn’t about planning or communication.

It’s about how organizations reveal their values under stress.

If this disruption affected full-time internal staff, exceptions would be made. Temporary authorizations would appear. Problems would be “solved.”

Because it affects contractors and vendors, it becomes normal.

That asymmetry tells you everything you need to know.

## Why Leaving Is Rational

As software engineers, we’re trained to recognize patterns.

When a system fails once, that’s a bug. When it fails the same way every year, with advance warning and no corrective action, that’s not a bug—it’s *broken as designed*.

I eventually realized that no amount of professionalism, patience, or “being a team player” was going to fix a system like this. The incentives are locked in. The risk is intentionally pushed downward. The people absorbing the pain are not the ones empowered to change it.

So here’s the call to action I wish I’d taken sooner:

If you find yourself in an environment where predictable dysfunction is normalized, where continuity is sacrificed to protect bureaucratic comfort, and where you’re expected to absorb instability so the system can pretend it’s healthy—leave.

Not out of anger. Out of engineering judgment.

Some systems don’t get refactored. They get exited.
